# Issue #1: Project Setup and Development Environment

**Priority**: High  
**Labels**: setup, infrastructure, documentation  
**Milestone**: Phase 1 - Foundation  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

## Summary
Set up the basic project structure, development environment, and build tools for the KubeRedis HTTP Gateway project.

## Motivation
Establishing a solid foundation is crucial for efficient development. This includes setting up proper directory structure, build tools, CI/CD pipeline, and development guidelines.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Requirements
- Create multi-language project structure (Rust for gateway, potentially Go for operator)
- Set up build tools and dependency management
- Configure development containerization
- Establish coding standards and linting
- Set up basic CI/CD pipeline

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project directory structure is organized by component
- [ ] Rust workspace is configured with proper Cargo.toml
- [ ] Development Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are created
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for CI is configured
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks are set up for code quality
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md and development setup guide are created
- [ ] .gitignore is properly configured for Rust/Go/Kubernetes projects

```

#### Build Configuration
- Rust workspace with gateway as main crate
- Cross-compilation support for Linux containers
- Multi-stage Dockerfiles for optimal image size
- Make targets for common development tasks

### Definition of Done
- Developer can clone repo and run `make dev` to start development environment
- CI pipeline passes with basic lint/test stages
- Code formatting and linting rules are enforced
- Project builds successfully in containers

### Dependencies
- None (foundation issue)

### Additional Context
- Follow Rust community best practices
- Consider using tools like `just` for task running
- Implement semantic versioning from start
- Set up conventional commit patterns
